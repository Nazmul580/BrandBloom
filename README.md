Agency Website Assignment

This is a simple agency website created as an assignment for my MERN web development course. The website meets the given requirements by using Bootstrap and includes four main sections: Home, About, Services, and Contact.

Project Overview

	•	Purpose: Build a basic agency website that meets specific design and functional requirements using Bootstrap.
	•	Sections:
	•	Home: Introduction to the agency.
	•	About: Brief information about the agency.
	•	Services: Description of services provided by the agency.
	•	Contact: Contact information and form for clients.

Development Approach

	•	Bootstrap: Primarily used Bootstrap classes for layout, font sizes, margins, and padding, minimizing custom CSS as much as possible.
	•	Custom CSS: Used minimal custom CSS for:
	•	Slider functionality.
	•	Hover effects.
	•	Custom buttons.
	•	Responsive Design: Employed Bootstrap’s responsive grid system and rem units for custom sizing, which allowed for responsiveness without the need for media queries.
	•	Design: Created a simple, clean layout suitable for an agency website.

Challenges

	•	Image Quality: It was challenging to find high-quality images for the website, so the image quality may be lower than desired.

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

	2.	Open the project in your preferred editor and open index.html in your browser to view the website.
